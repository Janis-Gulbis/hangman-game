## Description
This project is a simple Python-based word-guessing game where the computer randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the user must guess the letters in the word. The project's primary goal is to build familiarity with basic Python syntax, functions, and user input validation.

### Key Features
* Validates user input to ensure it's a single alphabetical character.
* Checks whether the guessed letter is in the randomly selected word.
* Provides feedback based on whether the guessed letter is correct or not.

### Aim of the Project
This project aims to help developers practice:
1. Using loops and conditional statements.
2. Writing reusable functions.
3. Implementing basic input validation.
4. Formatting strings for feedback.

### What I Learned 
This project reinforced concepts of:
* Working with <mark>while</mark> loops and input validation.
* Using Pythonâ€™s <mark>random.choice</mark> for random word selection.
* Structuring code into reusable functions for better organization.
