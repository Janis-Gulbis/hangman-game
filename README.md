Welcome to the Hangman Game project! This is a Python-based implementation of the classic word-guessing game where players try to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts.

## Project Description
This project is a command-line game built in Python that simulates the game of Hangman. A word is chosen randomly from a list of words, and the player must guess the word letter by letter. Each incorrect guess costs the player a life. The game ends when either:

* The player successfully guesses the word, or
* The player runs out of lives.

This project also showcases good practices in Python programming, including:

* Classes and object-oriented programming.
* Methods to validate user input.
* Looping constructs and conditionals.
* Basic data manipulation with lists and strings.

## Features
* Random Word Selection: A random word is chosen from a predefined list at the start of each game.
* Input Validation: Ensures that each guess is a single, alphabetical character that hasn't already been guessed.
* Life Counter: Tracks remaining lives and ends the game when lives reach zero.
* Dynamic Word Reveal: Shows the playerâ€™s progress by revealing correct guesses in the hidden word.
* Win and Lose Scenarios: Congratulates the player on a win, or displays a loss message if lives run out.

## Learning Objectives
This project aims to reinforce fundamental programming concepts:

* Working with classes and instance attributes in Python.
* Using loops, conditionals, and functions effectively.
* Implementing data validation for user input.
* Using lists, strings, and basic data manipulation techniques.
* Creating a simple command-line game experience.
